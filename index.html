                        (Verse 1)
                        This was never the way I planned, not my intention
                        I got so brave grant in hand, lost my discretion
                        It's not what I'm used to, just wanna study neurons
                        I'm curious for it, caught my attention
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Chorus)
                        I did ephys and I liked it, the neuron I poked was spiking
                        I did ephys just to try it, I hope Andy Penn won't mind it
                        It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I@ll patch clamp tonight
                        I did ephys and I liked it
                        I liked it

                        No I don't even know your genotype it doesn't matter
                        You're my experimental game, just murine nature
                        It's not what good mice do, not how they should behave
                        My brain gets so confused, they don't obey
                    </p>

                        Neurons they are so magical
                        Soft skin, red media, so patchable
                        Hard to approach, no giga-seal
                        Too good to deny it
                        Ain't no big deal it's in a 
                        solution of appropriate osmotic potential

                        (Verse 1)
                        Asked a peptide what she wanted to be 
                        She said "baby, can't you see?"
                        Im transmembranous, with ion-sensing motifs 
                        'Cause I'm a conductive channel protein

                        And maybe I'll love you

                        (Verse 2)
                        I told that peptide that G proteins were cool
                        she said "signal transduction - it's understood"
                        Medium-term transcriptional changes are all very fine
                        But I can help you depolarise!

                        Baby, you can drive my charge
                        Conductance propagates so far
                        Equilibrium potentials are
                        The basis of resting voltage

                        (Verse 3)
                        I told that Andy I could start right away
                        When he said, "Listen, babe, I got something to say
                        I got no grant and it's breaking my heart
                        But I found Scott Kinghorn and that's a start"

                        Baby, you can drive my charge

                        Baby, you can drive my charge
                        And maybe I'll love you

                        (Verse 1)
                        Lucky that the signal's coming through so
                        We can change the cell resistance
                        Lucky that the glutamate is loose so
                        That it can bridge synaptic distance
                        Baby, when the channels open wide
                        The sodium can come rushing in
                        Depolarizing CA1 from inside
                        That is how it all begin

                        You get some LTP
                        
                        It's hebbian
                        It's plastic
                        This process is fantastic

                        (Verse 2)
                        Lucky that the block begins to tumble
                        Freeing up the pore's dimension
                        Lucky that Magnesium is humble
                        So that the Calcium gets attention
                        Kinases wake up inside the cover
                        To make it stronger when we need it
                        these two cells are bound to one another
                        That's how the hippocampus reads it
